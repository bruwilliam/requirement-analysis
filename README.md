# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.

## Description
This repository will contain information related to gathering, analysis and elicitation of user requirements for software development projects.

## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirements Analysis is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and constraints of stakeholders (users, clients, or business teams) to define what a software system must do. It ensures that developers build the right product by clarifying functionality, performance, security, and usability expectations.

### What is it's role in the software development life cycle?
Requirements analysis is a critical phase in the SDLC, typically occurring after feasibility studies and before system design. Its key roles include:

1. Bridges Business Needs & Technical Solutions<br>
Translates stakeholder expectations into clear, actionable software specifications.

2. Defines Scope & Objectives<br>
Identifies what the system should do (functional requirements). Specifies constraints like performance, security, and compliance (non-functional requirements).

3. Reduces Development Risks<br>
Uncovers ambiguities, conflicts, or missing requirements early. Prevents feature creep (uncontrolled addition of features) by setting priorities.

4. Forms the Basis for Design & Testing<br>
Developers use requirements to architect the system. QA teams rely on them to create test cases (e.g., acceptance criteria).

5. Supports Project Planning<br>
Helps estimate time, cost, and resources needed. Enables better sprint planning in Agile methodologies.
